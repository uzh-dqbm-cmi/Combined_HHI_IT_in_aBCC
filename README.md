Code used to process the data and generate the figures for the paper.

The R markdown files contain the code for processing the count matrices (downloadable from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17814765) and for producing the figures of the manuscript.
PBMC_figures.Rmd has the code used to process the PBMC data and plot Figure 3 and Suppl. Figures 2 and 3. Spatial_figures.Rmd has the code for processing the spatial data and to plot Figure 4 and Suppl. Figures 4 and 5 of the manuscript. Also note, that an external dataset is used to provide reference for the cell-typing. Access to this dataset can be requested here: https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001005891 .
